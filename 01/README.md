Knowledge of language:

1   No experience before

2   Have read a bit about it, or worked with a closely related language

3   Have written a few trivial things in it

4   Worked with in the past, but no extensive experience

5   Multiple years experience

Bash
>Knowledge: 5

>Over 30 years experience with ksh or bash. Terrible language, but it's hard to avoid using.

C
>Knowledge: 4.2

>I loved C in the 80s, but have done my best to avoid it the past 25 years. It's not fun.

CLisp
>Knowledge: 3

>I played with it for fun for a couple years in the 90s

Forth
>Knowledge: 2

>I've never touched Forth before this year, but I dabbled in PostScript for fun in the 90s

Golang
>Knowledge: 1

>I've heard people talk about, but never looked into it. Most annoying thing: references that
>are not used block compilation. It makes it really difficult to comment things out briefly
>when debugging or testing.

PHP
>Knowledge: 4

>I worked at a PHP shop for over a decade, though as a systems administrator, not a developer.
>However, during this time I spent a lot of time helping developers debug code, and occasionally
>I would end up fixing bugs and writing short things. Also, I HATE PHP.

Pike
>Knowledge: 5

>This was my primary scripting language for nearly 20 years. I know the creator of the language
>and have done non-trivial, large projects. However, I mostly stopped using it in 2014.

Python
>Knowledge: 5

>My primary language for the past 6 years, mostly used as a systems administration-type language.

R
>Knowledge: 2.5

>I read a book on it and started learning it in 2014, but then I changed jobs and didn't need
>that toolset anymore, so I forgot all about it.

Ruby
>Knowledge: 4

>I wrote a lot with it in 2014, when I was looking for a language with better libraries than Pike.
>I love nearly everything about it, but I ended up switching to Python as my main scripting language.

Problem: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1

Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

1721
979
366
299
675
1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

Your puzzle answer was 731731.

--- Part Two ---

The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?

Your puzzle answer was 116115990.
