2020 Advent of Code solutions

https://adventofcode.com/2020

I did them originally all in Python, and then went back and improved some, then 
did some other languages. Forth & Golang are completely new to me. A couple
days are missing solutions because my effort was too embarrassingly messy to
share and I haven't fixed them up yet.
